# Discover learned processes and network connections

Next, let's have a look what NeuVector already learned about our sample app.

Open the app in the browser again: http://sample-app.default.${PUBLIC_IP}.sslip.io.

Then go to **Policy > Groups** and select the **nv.sample-app.default** group.

Check the process profile rules and network rules that have been learned.
