# Deactivate Zero Drift for sample-app

Next let's de-activate NeuVector's Zero Drift Prevention Mode. While this mode is very useful, it makes it a bit harder to see how NeuVector can learn running processes inside of a container and block not needed ones.

* Go to **Policy > Groups**
* Check the checkbox next to **Name** in the title bar to select all groups.
* Click on **Switch Mode**
* Set the Zero Drift Mode to **Basic**
* Click **Submit**
